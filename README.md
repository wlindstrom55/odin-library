# The Odin Project - Library JS project
- This project deals with objects mainly: constructing, accessing, and changing them.
    - There is also some usage of HTML forms and tables, both of which I hadn't really practiced much yet.
        - Also some good array practice. 
- I have also returned to this project to add some simmple built-in HTML form validation (8/15/22)
- As of now the project will not contain a back-end. But maybe later.
